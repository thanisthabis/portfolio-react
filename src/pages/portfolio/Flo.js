                                            As a member of the Design Innovation Club at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I worked on a five-month project to redesign the Flo mobile app, a comprehensive period tracking and holistic health platform. Flo helps users track their periods, symptoms, fertility chances, and baby‚Äôs growth, while also providing insights into body signals and evidence-based health articles.  In this project, I was responsible for the UI design of the onboarding process as part of the broader UX work done by my team. Our goal was to make the app more inclusive and enhance its usefulness by refining the paywall structure, ultimately improving the overall user experience.                                            </div>

                                            By marketing itself as a female health app, Flo excludes individuals beyond the female binary, hindering accessibility to a diverse user base. Alongside this, Flo‚Äôs current paywall structure diminishes the user experience by restricting access to beneficial health resources.

This process evolved from low-fidelity designs to the development of a high-fidelity prototype, all aimed at enhancing the user experience.

                                                During the Flo redesign project, I learned how to make period tracking apps more inclusive, moving away from stereotypically feminine designs to cater to diverse users. I also gained insight into balancing design with business needs, ensuring transparency with paywalls to build trust and avoid negative user experiences. To enhance the premium version's appeal, I explored adding valuable features like private sessions with doctors. Additionally, I developed hard skills in prototyping animations in Figma, including working with gradient backgrounds and linking interactive elements. This project strengthened my proficiency in complex prototyping and animation.
