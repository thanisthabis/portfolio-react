                                            In 2023, I had the opportunity to work with the Design Innovation Club at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for a duration of five months. I undertook the challenging task of redesigning the Roblox mobile app by modernizing interface, with a strong emphasis on personalization for users. My contribution to this project was twofold: firstly, I developed an innovative feature, a game-curated quiz, designed to enhance user engagement. Secondly, I was responsible for revamping the UI of two key areas - the avatar customization and discovery pages, infusing them with a modern aesthetic while improving user experience.

                                            The UI of the Roblox Mobile App is currently facing significant challenges. Its design feels outdated, and the interface suffers from cluttered components, making the overall browsing experience less user-friendly.

                                                During my involvement in the Roblox redesign project, I gained valuable insights into the significance of user experience and the critical process of data collection, a new aspect for me. I learned the skill of preserving the app's existing tone and style while integrating new features and concepts that align with its overall mood. Additionally, working within a UX team taught me the importance of regularly reviewing each other's designs to ensure theme consistency across the app and the value of collaboration.
